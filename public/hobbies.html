    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>

        <h2><li> Playing Video Games</li></h2>

        <p>Video games are my entertainment of choice; I rarely have time to catch up on movies or TV shows as I try to catch up to my backlog!</p>
        <h2><li>Baking</li></h2>

        <p>Baking is a skill I picked up during the pandemic and didn't expect to enjoy so much. Originally I only intednded to make millionaire shortbread once, as it wasn't readily available in South Korea. However, I found the process rewarding and begun to bake cookies and cakes regularly and share them at work. It was hard work with a tiny oven!</p>
        <h2><li>Exercising</li></h2>

        <p>Another habit I picked up in Korea was exercising regularly; there was a gym in the same building I worked in, so it was easy to go before or after work and do some self-improvement. Yet to get back into fitness since returning to the UK though, unfortunately &#128517;</p>
